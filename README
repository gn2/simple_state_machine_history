SimpleStateMachineHistory
=========================

I love using AASM (http://github.com/rubyist/aasm/tree/master). However, I sometimes like to keep track of the evolution of my state machines. This is what this plugin does.

Just add the following in your model:

  state_machine_history

The default column for state is :state. If your state machine is using a different column, you can specify it like this:

  state_machine_history :column => :status_column


Todo
====
Handle migration for SimpleStateTransition model (test+code+doc)


Example
=======

class TestStateMachine < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM
  aasm_column :state
  aasm_initial_state :pending
  aasm_state :pending
  aasm_state :active
  aasm_event :activate do
    transitions :from => :pending, :to => :active 
  end
  state_machine_history
end


class AnotherTestStateMachine < ActiveRecord::Base
  include AASM
  aasm_column :status_column
  aasm_initial_state :pending
  aasm_state :pending
  aasm_state :active
  aasm_event :activate do
    transitions :from => :pending, :to => :active 
  end
  state_machine_history :column => :status_column
end
